Projects that I worked on during my MSBA classes

Deep Learning CNN: Trains a conventional neural network to train on x-ray images to detect pneumonia in unlabeled x-rays

Holy Cross_Housing_Model: A random forest model developed to learn prior housing decisions from the HCC Res-Life team and then predict where the staff would have placed new students

London_Energy_Timeseries: a collection of time series models developed to predict the average household's energy consumption in London

NFL_Win_Prob: A random forest model trained on NFL pbp data to return the % chance a team in the same situation has won the game, much like ESPN's FPI

Restaurant Pricing Value: A linear regression model that predicts the earnings potential of various restaurants 

Shakespeare Project Authorship: a webscraping script that pulls in authorship data from CBS sportswriters and also reads in txt files from Shakespeare to predict the likelihood Shakespeare actually wrote unlabeled plays

Transcription Machine: a localized version of Open AI's Whisper model that cleans audio and then transcribes it before returning the output as a txt file

Wrangling Project: a script that analyzes CFB team stats to determine the top-10 teams of the four-team CFP era
